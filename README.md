# MachineLearning

Welcome to my MachineLearning repository. This repository serves as a collection of my own implementations of common machine learning algorithms in Python. It serves several purposes:

1. To refresh my understanding of these algorithms

2. To provide recruiters and interviewers examples of my python code.

To see the code for a given implementation, click on the file name of that implementation (i.e. to see my implementation of logistic regression, see LogisticRegression.Py). All implementations are designed to run as-is provided the necessary packages are installed. I rely only on common packages such as numpy and pandas, and do not use any outside implementations of these algorithms (which would defeat the entire purpose of this). 

My implementations are based on the reference
