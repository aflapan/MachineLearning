# MachineLearning

Welcome to my MachineLearning repository. This repository serves as a collection of my own implementations of common machine learning algorithms in python. It serves several purposes:

1. To refresh my understanding of these algorithms

2. To provide recruiters and interviewers examples of my python code.
